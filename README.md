This is a simple rubber duck mod for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), targeting Minecraft 1.20.2. It is a port of [salvadormg15's rubber duck mod for Forge](https://github.com/salvadormg15/Rubber-Duck), though some functionality has been changed.

This mod adds the rubber duck block, a cute little fellow that you can use to decorate your home! You can hold rubber ducks in your hand, hide them for guests to find in your house, or even place them on your head! Even better, they squeak when you right click them! There is a small chance of finding rubber ducks in naturally generating dungeons, for your survival needs. Unlock hundreds of possibilities with this small, adorable mod!
