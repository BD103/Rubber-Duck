# Rubber Duck

This is a simple rubber duck mod for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), targeting Minecraft 1.20. It is a port of [salvadormg15's rubber duck mod for Forge](https://github.com/salvadormg15/Rubber-Duck), though some functionality has been changed. 

## Dependencies

- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) >= 0.14.24
- [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin) >= 1.9.20

## Credits

The rubber duck texture, model, and squeak noise were all designed by [@salvadormg15](https://github.com/salvadormg15). They have been copied over with permission (salvadormg15/Rubber-Duck#11). The code is also inspired by the original.
